555 Timer LED Flasher

Description:
The 555 Timer LED flasher circuit is a basic timing circuit where the 555 timer IC is configured in astable mode. It continuously switches an LED on and off at regular intervals, making it blink. The blinking rate can be adjusted using two resistors and one capacitor connected to the IC.

Key Components:

555 Timer IC

2 Resistors (R1, R2)

1 Capacitor (C1)

LED with a current-limiting resistor


Applications:
Used in blinking lights, simple indicators, and as a base for more advanced timing circuits.
